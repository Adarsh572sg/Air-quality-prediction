## Introduction

Air quality prediction is a crucial task for environmental monitoring and public health. This project aims to develop machine learning models to predict air quality indices based on historical data and various environmental factors.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Adarsh572sg/Air-quality-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Air-quality-prediction
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies. It is recommended to use a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. (Optional) If you are using Jupyter notebooks, you may need to install Jupyter:
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter
   ```

## Usage

To run the Jupyter notebooks and explore the project, use the following command:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
This will open the Jupyter notebook interface in your web browser. You can then navigate to the desired notebook and run the code cells.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:
